Clock Work Mod (CWM) is probably most known so we will use that one. First, download the binary which fits your phone from [CWM site](https://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager "CWM site"). For example, my nexus 4's fited one is recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.4.7-mako.img. Then execute in bash:

{% highlight bash %}
    fastboot flash recovery recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.4.7-mako.img
{% endhighlight %}

Now, the CWM recovery mode is okay now.

Download the superuser.zip from [CWM superuser](http://download.clockworkmod.com/superuser/superuser.zip "CWM superuser"). Use adb to push the downloaded superuser.zip into /ment/sdcard/ on the phone, execute:

{% highlight bash %}
    adb push superuser.zip /mnt/sdcard/
{% endhighlight %}
  
Then reboot the phone, change into the recovery mode, use the CWM's UI to select the superuser.zip to install it on the phone.
