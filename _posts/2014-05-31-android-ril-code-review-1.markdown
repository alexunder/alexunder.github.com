# RIL Overview

RIL is the abbreviation of "Radio Interface Layer". In the Android software platform, the RIL subsystem communicates with BaseBand chip downwards and provides the Android framework with phones' related services upwards, such as Call, SMS, etc. Its location in android software  stack is shown in the graph below:

In the lower layer, RIL communicates with Baseband chip via the Linux virtual UART driver, we don't want to cover some details about the interactions between the UART driver and the real baseband chip, in this place, this serial port is on behalf of the baseband chip. In the upper layer, RIL communicates with the framework via socket. The Java layer in the framework is not our point, what we will talk about is the green part in the above graph.

# The compoents in RIL

The google company seprated the RIL into three parts in order to protect the IP of the OEM. These parts are: RIL daemon application(RILD), libril.so and reference-ril.so. The RILD and the libril.so reference each other in static linking, their implementations are open to us, but reference-ril.so is the reference implementation which is provided by Google to OEMs. Because of the diversity and the complexity of all kinds of the mobile network. The oem vendors have their own process routines in their baseband chip, they may don't want to open the source code, so they implement their own vendor-ril.so. In order to loose coupling between the private module and the open source module, RILD uses the dynamic loading method to communicate with vendor-ril.so. Their source codes are at:

	RILD--
		hardware/ril/rild

	libril--
		hardware/ril/libril   

Furthermore, the libril.so and the reference-ril.so have different functions in RIL architecture, libril.so is used to handle I/O messages with Android Framework via socket. But reference-ril.so is responsible for communicating with the serial port. 

# Start from RILD

The entire RIL system is initiated by the invoking RILD command from the shell, so let's start with it.

There is a static structure object in rild.c:

{% highlight c %}
static struct RIL_Env s_rilEnv = {
    RIL_onRequestComplete,
    RIL_onUnsolicitedResponse,
    RIL_requestTimedCallback,
};
{% endhighlight %}


It includes three function pointers, their implementations are at libril.so, and they will be used by the vendor ril. On the contrary, there is another similar structure defined in Ril.h:

{% highlight c %}
typedef struct {
	int version;        /* set to RIL_VERSION */
	RIL_RequestFunc onRequest;
	RIL_RadioStateRequest onStateRequest;
	RIL_Supports supports;
	RIL_Cancel onCancel;
	RIL_GetVersion getVersion;
} RIL_RadioFunctions;
{% endhighlight %}

This structure includes five function pointers, their implementations are at vendor ril, they will be used by libril.so. So, vendor ril and libril.so invoke each other's function to implement the RIL system. By the way, libril.so and rild are connected by static linking. But android wants to hide the OEM vendor's implementation, vendor-ril.so is connected with rild by dynamic linking. So let's look at the code snippets of the dynamic loading of reference-ril.so:

{% highlight c %}
dlHandle = dlopen(rilLibPath, RTLD_NOW);
if (dlHandle == NULL) {
	fprintf(stderr, "dlopen failed: %s\n", dlerror());
	exit(-1);
}

RIL_startEventLoop();
rilInit = (const RIL_RadioFunctions *(*)(const struct RIL_Env *, int, char **))dlsym(dlHandle, "RIL_Init");
if (rilInit == NULL) {
	fprintf(stderr, "RIL_Init not defined or exported in %s\n", rilLibPath);
	exit(-1);
}
{% endhighlight %}

As the code snippets show us, we get the path of the vendor ril from the configuration file, then invoke RIL_startEventLoop, its implementation is in libril.so, that the code below:

{% highlight c %}
extern "C" void
RIL_startEventLoop(void) {
	int ret;
	pthread_attr_t attr;
		
	/* spin up eventLoop thread and wait for it to get started */
	s_started = 0;
	pthread_mutex_lock(&s_startupMutex);
		
	pthread_attr_init (&attr);
	pthread_attr_setdetachstate(&attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);
	ret = pthread_create(&s_tid_dispatch, &attr, eventLoop, NULL);

	while (s_started == 0) {
		pthread_cond_wait(&s_startupCond, &s_startupMutex);
	}

	pthread_mutex_unlock(&s_startupMutex);

	if (ret < 0) {
		LOGE("Failed to create dispatch thread errno:%d", errno);
		return;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

We will discuss this function's detail in the next section, so let's continue to check the main function's routine of RILD, after invoking RIL_startEventLoop, we get the function pointer of "RIL_Init" in vendor ril, then after checking the validation of the function pointer, we invoke it with main's input parameters:

{% highlight c %}
rilArgv[0] = argv[0];
	
funcs = rilInit(&s_rilEnv, argc, rilArgv);

LOGD("RIL_register %d", cardNum);
RIL_register(funcs,cardNum);
{% endhighlight %}

The RIL_Init implemented in vendor ril will do some low layer's jobs: 

* Set the RIL_RadioFunctions pointer to vendor ril, so vendor ril can call libril's functions.
* Launching the mainLoop thread to handle hardware , including initializing the UART, reading data from the UART. 
* Returning five function pointers that will be used in libril.so to RILD. 

We will talk about it with more details in a later section. The last invoking is RIL_register, we transfer the previous function pointers into libril.so via this function. Inner the RIL_register, it connects the socket to communicate the framework, and launch the listenCallback event, it's like an engine can always trigger the I/O jobs. 

For a summary of the rild routine, there is a graph below:
